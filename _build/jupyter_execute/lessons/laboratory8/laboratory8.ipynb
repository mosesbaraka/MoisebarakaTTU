    "4. Move the depth logger to the same elevation as the height of V notch and reset the value to zero.\n",
    "5. Make sure the manometer valves corresponding to the selected orifice(s) is(are) open.\n",
    "4. Ensure the manometers are free of air bubbles.\n",
    "5. Open the red valve(s) to let flow into the flume.\n",
    "6. Move the depth logger till it touches the top of the water level. Measure the height. Record this measurement.\n",

    "**Part2**\n",
    "This can be conducted with the weir in place\n",
    "1. Move the depth logger to top of one of the rocks and reset the value to zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Part 3**\n",

    "1. Shut down the pumps, close the red valves, and remove the weir - everything else can be left as-is.\n",
    "2. Set the slope to 4-percent (its going to look steep, but the machine can handle it!)\n",
    "3. Start the pumps (you can try with just a single pump if you wish).\n",
    "4. Raise the tailgate a lot!\n",
    "5. Zero the depth gage to the channel bottom.\n",
    "6. Open the red valve(s) to start the flow.  \n",
    "7. Raise the headgate to just above the water height.\n",
    "8. Lower the tailgate a little bit at a time - you will likely observe two jumps, one near the head gate and one after the rocks.  The stable one is the one at the head gate.\n",

    "10. Record the manometer readings for the pump(s)\n",
    "11. Measure the flow depth befor the jump (halfway between the headgate and the jump should do). This is the alternate depth.\n",
