    "The Archimedes' principle states *when a solid object is com-\n",
    "pletely immersed into a fluid (say water), the volume of the fluid displaced is\n",
    "equal to the volume of the object.* When an object is partially displaced then\n",
    "the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the portion of the object that\n",
    "is immersed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes principle is useful to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects - Simply submerge them into a liquid and measure the volume displaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed representation is \n",
    "- when a solid object is fully or partially submerged into a liquid then the upward buoyant force exerted by the liquid on the object is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object. Mathematically, this can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = W_f = \\rho  V_f g $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $V_f$ is the volume of the liquid displaced m3, $\\rho$ is the density of the liquid ($\\frac{$kg}{m^3}$), $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and $B$ is the buoyant force ($N$) and $W_f$ is the weight of the displaced liquid ($N$).\n",

    "The weight of the object causes the body to sink into the liquid, while the upward buoyant force tries\n",
    "to push it up. If the object does not sink further (or raise) then these forces are balanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a submerged object, the volume of the object equals the volume of the liquid displaced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the resultant force can be written as:\n",
    "$$B - w_o = (\\rho_{f} - \\rho_{o}) V_{o} g$$\n",

    "the gravitational acceleration and $V_o$ is the volume of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "From, Archimedes Principle, the Buoyant force (B) is equal to the weight of\n",

    "It is important to remember that when an object sinks to the bottom of the\n",

    "force is still equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced. However,\n",
    "the upward buoyant force exerted on the object is insufficient to overcome\n",
    "the downward gravitational force which causes the object to sink. In this\n",
    "situation, as the object is fully submerged, the volume of the object is equal\n",

    "liquid. However, the upward buoyant force of the liquid exactly balances the\n",
    "weight of the object. Also, from Archimedes principle, the buoyant force is\n",
