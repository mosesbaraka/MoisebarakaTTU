## Catalog Entry

3105—Mechanics of Fluids Laboratory (1). Prerequisite: CE 3305. Experimental studies of fluid behavior.

##  Course Description
CE3105 is the laboratory course in fluids and flow phenomena and is closely linked to the lecture course. It is intended to draw to student's attention the behavior of real fluids and to expose students to experimental methods. The class will also improve technical writing skills and prepare students for the fluid mechanics section of the FE Exam. This course emphasizes collaboration through group work, and as such, a portion of the course grade will be based upon peer assessment.

Attendance and team participation is <strong> mandatory </strong>.
