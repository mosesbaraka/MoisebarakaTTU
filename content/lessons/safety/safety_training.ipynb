    "\n",
    "- Students must exercise common sense when handling equipment in the lab.\n",
    "- All CE 3105 experiments deal with water and laboratory equipment run on electricity\n",
    "- Water and electricity donâ€™t mix well\n",
    "  - Don't become a conductor; keep water away from electrical connections\n",
    "  - Don't earn a Darwin award or a spot on [Dumb Ways to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNR2EpS0jw)\n",
    "- The 110V single-phase sources are GFI protected; the 220V 3-Phase (the pump performance curve station is not)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Electricity leakage is sometimes detected by a slight tingling when you touch a cord or fitting.  If that happens, let go! and tell the instructor or assistant so we can inspect and repair the fitting.  Water leakage is going to happen, try to clean up splash and spills, and dont allow ponding to occur\n",
