    "A mass flow meter directly measures the flow by means of a near zero-inertia turbine that is rotated by liquid moving through the device (a mass flow sensor), the rotating turbine has a small ring that is magnetic, but is interrupted in one portion. Inside the cap is a hall detector (a coil) that converts the rotating magnetic field into a digital pulse that the microprocessor can count. These scale in size to very large devices but the general principle of operation is the same.  The figure below shows a small (20L/minute) flowmeter.\n",
