Welcome to the Fluid Mechanics Lab Experiments course at Texas Tech University. This course is designed to provide hands-on experience with various fluid mechanics phenomena. Below, you will find links to different chapters and experiments we will be conducting throughout the semester.

<!--
## Course Overview

In this lab-based course, we will explore the following topics:

- **Fluid Properties**: Viscosity, density, and surface tension.
- **Flow Measurement**: Devices such as Venturi meters, orifice plates, and Pitot tubes.
- **Open Channel Flow**: Flow patterns, critical flow, and hydraulic jumps.
- **Pipe Flow**: Laminar and turbulent flows, friction factor, and Reynolds number.
- **Forces on Submerged Surfaces**: Hydrostatic forces and buoyancy.
- **Pump and Turbine Performance**: Characteristics of fluid machines.-->

## Lab Materials

The following sections contain the lab manuals, worksheets, and assignments for each experiment:

### [Lab 1: Measurement of Fluid Properties](content/laboratory1.html)
In this lab, we will measure viscosity, density, and surface tension using different experimental setups.

### [Lab 2: Hydrostatic Forces and Buoyancy](content/laboratory2.html)
This lab covers the use of flow measurement devices such as the Venturi meter and Pitot tube.

### [Lab 3: Flow Measurement](content/laboratory3.html)
We will study flow patterns, the concept of critical flow, and hydraulic jumps in open channels.

### [Lab 4: Pipe Friction](content/laboratory4.html)
In this lab, we will explore laminar and turbulent flow regimes in pipes and calculate the friction factor.

### [Lab 5: Minor Losses in Pipe Systems](content/laboratory5.html)
This lab focuses on the calculation of hydrostatic forces on submerged surfaces.

### [Lab 6: Pump and Turbine Performance](content/lab6.md)
We will investigate the performance characteristics of pumps and turbines in fluid machines.
